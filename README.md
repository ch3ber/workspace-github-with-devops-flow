 The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow located at `.github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml` that runs on each push:

 ```yaml
 name: GitHub Actions Demo
 on: [push]
 jobs:
   Explore-GitHub-Actions:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v5
       - run: echo "Demo job running on GitHub Actions"
 ```
